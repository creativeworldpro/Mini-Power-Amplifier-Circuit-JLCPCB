In this project, we’ll teach you making a mini amplifier circuit. A mini amplifier is small enough to be portable and compact while still allowing enough amplification to be useful in certain settings. Smaller amps allow you the flexibility of getting the sound you might want in a smaller package.
A power amplifier (PA) converts a low-power signal to a higher power one.
Two common examples are audio amplifiers, used to drive loudspeakers and headphones, and RF power amplifiers, such as those used in the final stage of a transmitter.


Component List - 

To make this wireless power transfer circuit, we might need some electronics component.
All components list have been given below –
 
•	Mosfet – IRF Z44n

•	Resistor –  10 KΩ

•	Capacitor – 47/ 16v

•	Audio In Cable

•	Power – DC 12v

•	Diode – 1N 4007

•	Ceramic Capacitor - 1 µf

•	Speaker


Mosfet Pin Out - 

The metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor, also known as the metal–oxide–silicon transistor, is a type of insulated-gate field-effect transistor that is fabricated by the controlled oxidation of a semiconductor, typically silicon. 

Its 3 legs pin-out can be seen above - 

•	Gate

•	Drain

•	Source

Feature - 

•	Output power.

•	Distortion.

•	Gain.

•	Frequency response.

•	Impedance.

•	Sensitivity.

•	Signal-to-noise ratio.

•	Crosstalk.

To make this mini power amplifier circuit, we might need some electronics component. JLCPCB has its own parts library. JLCPCB has 200k+ in stock components, 24 hours rapid SMT assembly.

Circuit Connection – Step 1

To make this Mini Power Amplifier Circuit, 1st we connect 10 KΩ resistor with “Drain” and “Gate” leg of mosfet. Then we connect 47µf/16v capacitor with the circuit. We connect this capacitor positive leg with “Source” leg of mosfet.  Now we connect this capacitor negative leg with audio input ground cable.

We utilize JLCPCB https://jlcpcb.com/RTA to printout our PCB.


Circuit Connection – Step 2

Now we make a parallel connection with this 1µf ceramic capacitor. Then we make a series connection with 3 pieces rectifier diode. Then connect ceramic capacitor with diode negative and positive leg. 

We also make a series connection with this 3 pieces resistor. Then connect resistor 1 terminal with diode positive leg and connect it’s other terminal with positive leg of DC 12v.

Circuit Connection – Step 3

For input power, we are using DC 12v. We connect DC 12v positive leg with 1 terminal of sound speaker and connect DC 12v negative cable with source leg of mosfet. 

To get output , we need to connect a sound speaker. Sound speaker 1 terminal is connected with power source and we connect it’s other terminal with “Drain” leg of mosfet.

Finally connect audio input L/R cable with “Drain” leg of mosfet and our amplifier circuit is now ready for use.
Just connect mosfet with heat sink and plug-in power then enjoy the music.

Thanks to JLCPCB for offering us, this SMT PCB circuit.
